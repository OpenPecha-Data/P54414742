The Lightning Bolt of Compassion
A Short Prayer that Spontaneously Fulfils All Wishes (Sampa Lhundrupma)
by Do Khyentsé Yeshé Dorjé

emaho, könchok tsa sum deshek kündü pal
Emaho: O wonder! O Guru Rinpoche, in your glory you embody Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha; lama,
yidam and khandro; and all the sugatas,
nyikdü drowa gönmé kyab chikpu
The sole refuge of beings, who are without protection in this dark age.
tukjé lok tar nyurwé tötreng tsal
Your compassion is as swift as lightning, Tötreng Tsal.
maha guru pema herukar
Mahā Guru—wrathful Padma Heruka,
mögü dungshuk drakpö solwa deb
With fervent longing and devotion, we pray to you:
dra dön gek dang barché jepur dok
Avert enemies, döns, obstructing forces, obstacle-makers, curses and spells.
marung gyal sen jungpo dam la tok
Bring all negative forces, gyalpo, senmo and jungpo demons, under your subjugation,
sampa lhün gyi drubpar jingyi lob
Grant your blessings so that all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled.

When the signs of the times became apparent, at the request of the noble consort and son, Jalü
Dorjé uttered this, as a treasure from his wisdom mind.
