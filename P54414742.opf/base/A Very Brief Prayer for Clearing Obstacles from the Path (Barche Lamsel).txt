A Very Brief Prayer for Clearing Obstacles from the Path (Barché Lamsel)
by Do Khyentsé Yeshé Dorjé

om ah hung, chöku nangta longku chenrezik
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ! Dharmakāya Amitābha, saṃbhogakāya Avalokiteśvara,
tulku pema jungné drakpo tsal
Nirmāṇakāya Padmasambhava—the wrathful Drakpo Tsal,
solwa deb so tukjé shuk chung la
We pray to you; with the force of your compassion
chi nang sangwé barché ying su sol
Dissolve all obstacles, outer, inner and secret, into space!
dü ngen nyikmé drowa dukngal tsé
When beings suffer in this decadent dark age,
khyé lé resa mé do nying khong né
We have no other hope but you! From the depth of our hearts
mögü dungwé lhang lhang solwa deb
With fervent devotion and longing, urgently we pray:
galkyen chi nang sangwé barché dok
Avert bad circumstances, outer, inner and secret obstacles,
tsé sö pel la lungta dargyé shok
Let our lifespan and merit increase, and our lungta strengthen and grow!
